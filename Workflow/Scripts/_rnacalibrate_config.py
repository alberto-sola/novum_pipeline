"""RNAcalibrate ladder schema: cell geometry and DAG-build-time validation.

Stdlib only: the Snakefile imports it into the driver env, which ships none of the arms'
scientific deps. `rnacalibrate.py` and `rnahybrid.py` import it too.

Mirrors `_intarna_config.py`: lettered helpers, fatals first, then warnings concatenated.
