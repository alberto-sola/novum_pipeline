"""The env-driven import rules for the five shared sibling modules, in one table.

Each module runs in a different conda env, so its import list is a contract, not a style
preference: the two config modules are imported by the Snakefile into the DRIVER env (a
third-party import there breaks every snakemake invocation, --dry-run included), and
_common/_gumbel_fit are imported by scripts running in rnahybrid.yaml, which ships neither
pandas nor numpy. See CLAUDE.md, "Snakemake script convention".
