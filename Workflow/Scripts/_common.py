"""Dependency-light helpers shared across the Workflow/Scripts arms.

Kept deliberately free of third-party imports (no pandas): the RNAhybrid conda
env (`Workflow/Envs/rnahybrid.yaml`) ships no pandas, yet its scripts still need
`which_required` and `ensure_parent`, so importing this module must never pull a
heavy dependency. (The IntaRNA and postprocess envs do ship pandas.) Snakemake
puts each script's own directory on sys.path, so the sibling `from _common import
...` resolves when scripts run under the `script:` directive.
