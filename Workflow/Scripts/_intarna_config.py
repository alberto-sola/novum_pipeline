"""IntaRNA config schema: defaults, seed derivation, and DAG-build-time validation.

Imported by BOTH `intarna.py` (inside the IntaRNA conda env) and the Snakefile (at
DAG-build time, in the driver env). That second consumer is why this module must stay
**dependency-free** — stdlib only: the driver env ships none of the arms' scientific
dependencies. Keeping it separate from `intarna.py` also means the driver never imports
a script that ends in `run_from_snakemake(snakemake)`.
