"""Gumbel-fit quality control and the per-miRNA theta(L) power law.

Stdlib only: `rule rnacalibrate` runs in `rnahybrid.yaml`, which has no pandas or numpy.

The model:  theta(L) = C * [ln(m*n)] ** -alpha   (m = target length, n = query length),
a straight line in logs, so alpha is closed-form weighted least squares over a miRNA's own
anchors. Weights are 1/SE^2 with SE(ln theta) = 1.053/sqrt(N), from the measured
SE(theta_hat) = 1.053*theta/sqrt(N).

Tier 1 is not heuristic: every condition is a literal branch in RNAcalibrate's
`numerical.c`. See the `rnacalibrate-fit-window` memory.
